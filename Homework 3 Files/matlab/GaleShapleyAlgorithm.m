function [Match,NumStages] = GaleShapleyAlgorithm(P1,P2)
    % Skeleton code for Gale-Shapley algorithm.
    % Please do not change the filename or the function names!

    % Runs the Gale-Shapley algorithm, where agents in Group 1 (the group
    % corresponding to P1) propose.

    % Args:
        % P1: an m x n matrix describing the preferences of the agents in
        % Group 1. Each column is preference of each of m men.
        % P2: an m x n matrix describing the preferences of the agents in
        % Group 2. Each column is preference of each of n women.

    % Returns:
        % Match: an m x n matrix which indicates the matches after running
        % the algorithm.
        % NumStages: the number of stages that it takes the Gale-Shapley
        % algorithm to terminate.
