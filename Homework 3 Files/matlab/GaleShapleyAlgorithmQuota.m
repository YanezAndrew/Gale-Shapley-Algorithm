function [Match,NumStages] = GaleShapleyAlgorithmQuota(P1,P2,quota)
    % Skeleton code for Gale-Shapley algorithm.
    % Please do not change the filename or the function names!
    
    % Runs the Gale-Shapley algorithm, where agents in Group 1 (the group
    % corresponding to P1) propose. Each agent in P2 has a number of spots
    % available specified by the variable quota.

    % Args:
        % P1: an m x n matrix describing the preferences of the agents in
        % Group 1. Each column is preference of each of m men.
        % P2: an m x n matrix describing the preferences of the agents in
        % Group 2. Each column is preference of each of n women.
        % quota: an m x 1 vector describing the quota of each agent in
        % Group 2

    % Returns:
        % Match: an m x n matrix which indicates the matches after running
        % the algorithm
        % NumStages: the number of stages that it takes the Gale-Shapley
        % algorithm to return a proposal.
